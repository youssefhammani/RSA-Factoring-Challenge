# RSA-Factoring-Challenge

![RSA Factoring Challenge Banner](https://yourdomain.com/path/to/banner/image.png)

This project is designed as an optional but rewarding challenge, intended for individuals interested in cryptographic algorithms, prime factorization, and security protocols. The task involves the development of efficient programs to factorize numbers, essential for breaking RSA encryption.

## Overview

The RSA Factoring Challenge aims to break down large numbers used in RSA encryption into their prime components. Participants have two distinct tasks:

1. **Task 0: Factorize All the Things**
   - Develop a program/script that factors natural numbers into products of two smaller numbers. The output should display the factorizations in the format `n = p * q`.
   - Multiple numbers need to be factorized within a strict time limit.

2. **Task 1: RSA Factoring Challenge**
   - Similar to Task 0 but with a more rigorous requirement: the factorization should yield prime numbers.
   - Only one encrypted number will be provided, and the goal is to determine the two prime numbers that constitute this encrypted value.

## Prerequisites

- Operating System: Standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Programming Language: Participants can use the language of their choice.
- Understanding of RSA encryption, prime factorization, and algorithms for efficient factorization.

## Requirements

- Programs (`factors` and `rsa`) should run without external dependencies.
- Each task has a strict time limit of 5 seconds per execution.
- All scripts, source code, and necessary files must be pushed to the provided [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/RSA-Factoring-Challenge).

## Usage

### Task 0: Factorize All the Things

Run the program for Task 0 using the following command:

```bash
./factors <file>
```

Replace `<file>` with the file containing natural numbers to factor. Ensure each number is on a separate line.

### Task 1: RSA Factoring Challenge

Execute the program for Task 1 using:

```bash
./rsa <file>
```


Replace `<file>` with the file containing the encrypted number to be factorized.
